# 🧪 SQL Server – Copying and Restoring Databases

## 🎯 Objective

Learn two different methods to copy a database from one SQL Server instance (`North`) to another (`North\A`):

- Doing a **manual backup/restore**, handling logins, fixing orphaned users, and updating compatibility level.
- Using the **Copy Database Wizard (Detach and Attach)**  


---

## 🧩 Prerequisites

- You need sysadmin rights on both `North` and `North\A`.
- SQL Server Agent must be **running** on both servers.
- The database to be copied must be **offline-able** (for the wizard method).
- The database `AdventureWorks` should already exist on `North`.

---



## 🧷 Method 1 – Manual Backup and Restore  

If it not exists, create the folder C:\DbFiles

### 🔐 Step 1 – Create Login and User on the source server

Create a SQL Server login on the default instance:  

• Name: Liza  
• Password: myS3cret  

Create a user in the Adventureworks database for above login. The user should also be named Liza.

---

### 💾 Step 2 – Create and restore a backup

Create a backup of the Adventureworks database on the default instance. Use whatever backup file name and path you want (for instance C:\DbFiles\ Adventureworks.bak).  

Restore this backup on the A instance. Make sure that the database physical file names are different from the default instance’s names (since you are on the same machine).  

Update statistics on the restored database. This isn’t really related to doing an upgrade or copy/move of a database since the statistics comes with the backup and there are no changes between statistics format between versions. But almost everybody “out there” believes that this is necessary so feel free to do that if you have the time. Use the procedure sp_updatestats to do this.

---

### 🧩 Step 3 – Manage an orphaned user

Your SQL user Liza in the Adventureworks database on the A instance is orphaned.  

First, you want to list your orphaned users. Use sp_change_users_login to do this.  

And then you want to connect that user to a login. You have several options to do this  

1. Create a login for Liza and then use ALTER USER Liza WITH LOGIN = Liza (you can also use sp_change_users_login, if you prefer).  
2. Script out the login from the source instance using sp_help_revlogin (search and install from the internet) and then create the login on the A instance based on the command generated by sp_help_revlogin.  
3. Use some other of the many scripts available out there.

### ⚙️ Step 4 – Raise the Compatibility Level

Check current level:

Imagine that the developers/vendors now say that they support the new versions’s compatibility level.  

Also, imagine that you have been running your application with Query Store enabled for a couple of weeks so you have a history of your SQL queries, their execution plans and run-time statistics.  

You now feel that you want to raise the compatibility level for the database. Do that.

---

### ✅ Final Checks

* Confirm login `Liza` works on `North\A`.
* Validate that compatibility level is updated.
* Verify restored data in `AdventureWorks`.

## Method 1 Answer suggestions

### 🔐 Step 1 – Manual Backup and Restore 

On `North`:

```sql
CREATE LOGIN Liza WITH PASSWORD = 'myS3cret';
GO
USE AdventureWorks;
CREATE USER Liza;
```

---

### 💾 Step 2 – Create and restore a backup

1. On `North`, back up the database:

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE AdventureWorks
TO DISK = 'C:\DbFiles\AdventureWorks.bak';
```

2. On `North\A`, restore the database with different physical file names:

```sql
RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks
FROM DISK = 'C:\DbFiles\AdventureWorks.bak'
WITH MOVE 'AdventureWorks2017' TO 'C:\DbFiles\AdventureWorks2017.mdf',
     MOVE 'AdventureWorks2017_Log' TO 'C:\DbFiles\AdventureWorks2017_Log.ldf';
```

3. Optionally update statistics:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks;
EXEC sp_updatestats;
```

---

### 🧩 Step 3 – Manage an orphaned user

On `North\A`:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks;
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Report';
```

Create login for Liza:
```sql
CREATE LOGIN Liza WITH PASSWORD = 'myS3cret'
```

Then fix the orphaned user:

```sql
ALTER USER Liza WITH LOGIN = Liza;
```



---

### ⚙️ Step 4 – Raise the Compatibility Level

Check current level:

```sql
SELECT compatibility_level
FROM sys.databases
WHERE name = 'AdventureWorks';
```

Raise it (example for SQL Server 2019):

```sql
ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks
SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 150;
```

## 🧷 Method 2 – Copy Database Wizard (Detach and Attach)

### 🔐 Step 1 – Set SQL Server Agent Credentials on `North\A`

1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** on `North\A`.
2. Go to **SQL Server Services**.
3. Right-click **SQL Server Agent (NORTH\A)** > **Properties**.
4. In the **Log On** tab:
   - Select **This account**
   - Enter:
     - **User**: `Student`
     - **Password**: `myS3cret`
5. Click **OK** and restart the SQL Server Agent service.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2 – Create a Sample Database on `North`

Run on the `North` instance:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE MoveDb;
GO

USE MoveDb;
CREATE TABLE TestData (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100)
);
INSERT INTO TestData VALUES (1, 'Gamma'), (2, 'Delta');
````

---

### 🧙 Step 3 – Use the Copy Database Wizard (Detach and Attach)

1. In SSMS, connect to `North`.
2. Right-click the server > **Tasks** > **Copy Database**.
3. Click **Next** on the welcome screen.
4. Select `North` as the Source Server and click **Next**
5. Select `North\A` as the destination server and click **Next**
6. Choose **Use Detach and Attach method** → click **Next**.
7. Select to copy the database: `MoveDb` → click **Next**.
8. Set destination file paths if needed → click **Next**.
9. In Configure the Package → click **Next**.
10. Schedule the package to run immediately and click **Next**
11. Click **Finish** The database will be copied

---

### ✅ Step 4 – Confirm the Migration

On `North\A`, verify:

```sql
SELECT * FROM MoveDb.dbo.TestData;
```

---

### 📝 Notes (Detach and Attach)

* This method **takes the source database offline** during the transfer.
* It is **fast** for large databases but requires **downtime**.
* Make sure file paths are valid and accessible between the two servers.

---

### 📝 Notes (Manual Method)

* Use **different file names** to avoid collisions on same machine.
* `sp_updatestats` is often used after restores, even if not technically required.
* Raising compatibility level can affect performance and query behavior.
