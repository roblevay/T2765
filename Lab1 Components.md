# SQL Server Introductory Exercises

First, download the file Folders.bat from the Files folder and run it as administrator. The folders for the exercises will be created

### Exercise 1: Identify Version and Edition (20 min)

**Step 1: Using Object Explorer (GUI)**
- Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
- Connect to your default instance (`North`).
- Right-click on your instance name in Object Explorer and select **Properties**.
- Note down the **Product version** and **Edition** from the General page.

**Step 2: Using T-SQL queries**
- Open a new query window in SSMS.
- Run these queries:
```sql
SELECT @@VERSION AS SQLVersion;
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition;
```
- Verify if results match the information obtained via Object Explorer.

**Step 3: Using sqlcmd (command-line)**
- Open Command Prompt.
- Connect to the instance using sqlcmd:
```shell
sqlcmd -S North
```
- Execute these commands:
```sql
SELECT @@VERSION;
GO
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('Edition');
GO
```
- Compare the results again.

### Exercise 2: Manage SQL Server Instances and Services (20 min)

**Step 1: Use SQL Server Configuration Manager**
- Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
- Locate your two SQL Server instances (`North` and `North\A`).
- Stop and start the named instance (`North\A`).

**Step 2: Start/Stop Services Using Command Line**
- Open **Command Prompt**.
- First, type:
```shell
net start
```
- This will list all currently running services.
- Try to stop and start the SQL Server services:
```shell
net stop MSSQLSERVER
net start MSSQLSERVER
net stop MSSQL$A
net start MSSQL$A
```
- Try doing this **without admin rights** and observe what happens.
- Then try again using **Run as administrator**.
- Reflect on why admin access is required for managing services.
- Reconnect to both instances in SSMS to confirm they are up and running.
- Discuss isolation, security, and resource management for multiple instances.


### Exercise 3: Backup and Investigate Logging (20 min)

**Step 1: Perform a Backup of the `master` Database**
- Open SSMS and connect to the `North` instance.
- Run the following command:
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE master TO DISK = 'C:\temp\master.bak' WITH INIT;
```
- Make sure the file is created successfully.

**Step 2: Check SQL Server Error Log in SSMS**
- In SSMS, go to **Management** > **SQL Server Logs** > **Current**.
- Look for entries related to your backup.

**Step 3: Check the Windows Application Log**
- Open **Event Viewer**.
- Go to **Windows Logs** > **Application**.
- Filter for events from `MSSQLSERVER` or `SQLSERVERAGENT`.
- Locate entries about the backup.

**Step 4: Locate and Open the Error Log File Manually**
- Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
- Right-click the SQL Server instance and select **Properties**.
- Go to the **Startup Parameters** tab.
- Look for the `-e` parameter â€“ it shows the full path to the error log file.
- Navigate to the file in Windows Explorer and open it using **Notepad**.
- Confirm that the backup was logged there as well.
