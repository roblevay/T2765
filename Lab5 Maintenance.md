# Exercise 1: SQL Server Index Fragmentation & Statistics Exercise

## 🏁 Step 1: Create test database and table

```sql
CREATE DATABASE FragDemo;
GO

USE FragDemo;
GO

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Test;
GO

CREATE TABLE Test (
    ID INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Value CHAR(800)  -- Large rows to use up more space per page
);
GO
```

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Create index with low fill factor

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Test_Value 
ON Test(Value)
WITH (FILLFACTOR = 70);
GO
```

---

## 📥 Step 3: Insert rows to fill pages

```sql
INSERT INTO Test (Value)
VALUES (REPLICATE('A', 800));
GO 2000
```

---

## 🗑️ Step 4: Delete a portion of the data

```sql
DELETE FROM Test WHERE ID % 3 = 0;
```

---

## 🔁 Step 5: Insert more rows to cause fragmentation

```sql
INSERT INTO Test (Value)
VALUES (REPLICATE('B', 800));
GO 1000
```

---

## 🔍 Step 6: Check fragmentation

```sql
SELECT 
    index_type_desc,
    avg_fragmentation_in_percent,
    fragment_count,
    avg_page_space_used_in_percent
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (DB_ID(), OBJECT_ID('Test'), NULL, NULL, NULL);
```

---

## 🧹 Step 7: Reorganize and Rebuild

### Reorganize (lighter operation)

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_Test_Value ON Test REORGANIZE;
```

### Rebuild (heavier, but more effective)

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_Test_Value ON Test REBUILD;
```

---

## 📊 Step 8: Update statistics

### A. Update statistics for a specific table

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS Test;
```

### B. Update a specific index/statistics object

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS Test IX_Test_Value;
```

### C. Update all statistics in the database

```sql
EXEC sp_updatestats;
```

---

## ✅ Done!

You've now learned how to:
- Create a table and index
- Cause and detect fragmentation
- Reorganize or rebuild indexes
- Update statistics (per table and entire DB)

# 🛠️ Exercise 2: SQL Server Maintenance Plans – Step-by-Step Exercise

## 🎯 Objective

Create three separate maintenance plans in SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to:

1. Back up all user databases.
2. Perform database maintenance (index rebuild/reorganize and update statistics).
3. Clean up old backup files and maintenance history.

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites

- SQL Server Agent must be running.
- SSMS installed and connected to an instance.
- Sufficient permissions to create maintenance plans (typically sysadmin).

---

## 🔹 Plan 1: Back Up All User Databases

### Step-by-Step:

1. Open **SSMS** and connect to your SQL Server instance.
2. Expand **Management** > Right-click **Maintenance Plans** > Choose **New Maintenance Plan**.
3. Name the plan: `UserDatabaseBackup`. Wait for some time for the toolbox Maintenance Plan Tasks to appear.
4. In the toolbox (on the left), drag **Back Up Database Task** into the designer.
5. Double-click the task to configure:
   - **Backup type**: Full
   - **Databases**: All user databases
   - **Backup to**: Choose location (e.g. `C:\SQLBackups`)
   - Enable backup compression if supported
   - Optional: Create a sub-directory for each database
6. Click **OK**.
7. Click on the Add Subplan icon 
   - Name: `NightlyBackup`
   - Add a Schedule
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Time: e.g. 2:00 AM
8. Save the plan (Ctrl+S or File > Save).

---

## 🔹 Plan 2: Index and Statistics Maintenance

### Step-by-Step:

1. Right-click **Maintenance Plans** > **New Maintenance Plan**.
2. Name the plan: `IndexAndStatsMaintenance`.
3. Add **Rebuild Index Task**:
   - Databases: All user databases
   - Tables: All tables
4. Add **Update Statistics Task**:
   - Databases: All user databases
   - Scan type: Full scan 
5. Schedule the plan:
   - Frequency: Weekly
   - Time: e.g. Sunday at 3:00 AM
6. Save the plan.

---

## 🔹 Plan 3: Cleanup Old Backups and History

### Step-by-Step:

1. Create a new maintenance plan: `CleanupTasks`.
2. Add **Maintenance Cleanup Task**:
   - Delete: Backup files
   - Folder: Same as used in the backup plan (`C:\SQLBackups`)
   - File extension: `.bak`
   - File age: Delete files older than 7 days
3. Add another **Maintenance Cleanup Task**:
   - Delete: Maintenance Plan history
   - File age: Older than 30 days
4. Schedule:
   - Frequency: Weekly
   - Time: e.g. Sunday at 4:00 AM
5. Save the plan.

---

## ✅ Summary

This set of exercises helps automate key SQL Server maintenance:

- **Plan 1** ensures all databases are backed up nightly.
- **Plan 2** keeps indexes and stats optimized weekly.
- **Plan 3** prevents disk space and history buildup.

All can be created without writing T-SQL using the Maintenance Plan Wizard or Designer in SSMS.

If time permits, verify that the Sql Server Agent service is running and execute each of the plans by right-clicking and verifying that they run correctly.

# 🔧 Exercise 3: Using Ola Hallengren’s SQL Server Maintenance Solution

## 🎯 Objective

Set up Ola Hallengren’s widely used maintenance scripts to:

- Back up all user databases
- Perform index maintenance (rebuild if > 30% fragmentation, reorganize if 10–30%)
- Update statistics

---

## 📥 Step 1 – Download the Scripts

1. Go to the official website (right-click to open in new tab):  
   👉 <a href="https://ola.hallengren.com" target="_blank">https://ola.hallengren.com</a>

2. Click  “MaintenanceSolution.sql” under Getting Started

3. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and run the downloaded script against the **master** database.

   This will create:
   - Stored procedures (e.g., `dbo.DatabaseBackup`, `dbo.IndexOptimize`)
   - Support tables (e.g., `dbo.CommandLog`)
  

---

## 🧪 Step 2 – Run Backup for All User Databases

To back up all user databases to a folder (e.g., `C:\SQLBackups`):

```sql
EXEC dbo.DatabaseBackup
  @Databases = 'USER_DATABASES',
  @Directory = 'C:\SQLBackups',
  @BackupType = 'FULL',
  @Compress = 'Y',
  @CheckSum = 'Y',
  @LogToTable='Y';
```

You can schedule this using a SQL Agent job that runs nightly.

---






## 🔧 Step 3 – Index Maintenance

To rebuild/reorganize indexes based on fragmentation:

```sql
EXEC dbo.IndexOptimize
  @Databases = 'USER_DATABASES',
  @FragmentationLow = NULL,
  @FragmentationMedium = 'INDEX_REORGANIZE',
  @FragmentationHigh = 'INDEX_REBUILD_ONLINE',
  @FragmentationLevel1 = 10,
  @FragmentationLevel2 = 30,
  @UpdateStatistics = 'ALL',
  @LogToTable='Y';
```

- Reorganize if fragmentation is **10–30%**
- Rebuild if **>30%**
- Also updates statistics for all indexes

Schedule this weekly or as needed using SQL Agent.

---

## 🗂️ Optional: Command Log Table

You can review what actions were taken by querying:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbo.CommandLog ORDER BY StartTime DESC;
```

---

## ✅ Summary

With minimal setup, Ola Hallengren’s solution gives you:

- Reliable backups with checksums and compression
- Smart index and stats maintenance based on actual fragmentation
- Logging of all maintenance actions

Perfect for both small environments and enterprise-scale SQL Servers.
